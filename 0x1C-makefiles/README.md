# Project Title: alx-low_level_programming

## Description

This repository contains a collection of Makefiles for building the "school" executable. The Makefiles include rules for compiling source files, generating object files, and creating the final executable. Additionally, there are rules for cleaning up temporary files, object files, and the executable, as well as forcing a recompilation of all source files.

## Makefile Details

### 0. make -f 0-Makefile

- **Objective:** Create a basic Makefile that builds the "school" executable.
- **Command to Build:** `make -f 0-Makefile`

### 1. make -f 1-Makefile

- **Objective:** Introduce variables (`CC` and `SRC`) to the Makefile.
- **Command to Build:** `make -f 1-Makefile`

### 2. make -f 2-Makefile

- **Objective:** Use variables (`CC`, `SRC`, `OBJ`, and `NAME`) and introduce rules for cleaning and recompilation.
- **Command to Build:** `make -f 2-Makefile`

### 3. make -f 3-Makefile

- **Objective:** Enhance the Makefile with more rules (`clean`, `oclean`, `fclean`, and `re`).
- **Command to Build:** `make -f 3-Makefile`

### 4. A complete Makefile

- **Objective:** Add compiler flags (`CFLAGS`) to the Makefile.
- **Command to Build:** `make all -f 4-Makefile`

## Running the Examples

1. Clone the repository:


   git clone https://github.com/SheriffMudasir/alx-low_level_programming.git
